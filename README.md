# Public List of Bovaer-Free Products in Australia

Welcome to the **Public List of Bovaer-Free Products in Australia** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive list of dairy and meat products from brands that do not use the Bovaer food additive in their food chain.

## About

Bovaer is a feed additive used to reduce methane emissions from livestock. While it has its benefits, some consumers prefer products that do not include this additive. This list is designed to help those consumers make informed choices.

## Community Driven

This is a community-driven and supported project. We rely on contributions from individuals who are passionate about transparency in the food industry. If you have information about products or brands that should be included in this list, please consider contributing.

## How to Contribute
